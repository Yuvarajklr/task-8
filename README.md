# 🔐 Cybersecurity Internship Task - VPN Privacy & Security

## 📌 Task Name: Working with VPNs *(VPN Privacy Task)*

## 🎯 Objective

Understand how VPNs enhance online privacy and security by:
- Encrypting internet traffic
- Hiding the user's IP address
- Bypassing censorship and geographic restrictions

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **VPN Providers**: ProtonVPN / Windscribe VPN (Free Tier)
- **Websites for IP and Security Testing**:
  - https://whatismyipaddress.com
  - https://fast.com or https://speedtest.net
  - https://cloudflare.com/ssl/encrypted-sni/

---

## ✅ Steps Performed

### 1. VPN Installation
- Signed up on ProtonVPN.
- Installed VPN client (GUI on Windows / CLI on Linux).
- Connected to a VPN server (e.g., Netherlands).

### 2. IP Address Check
- Visited https://whatismyipaddress.com before and after connecting to VPN.
- Confirmed IP address changed from original (India) to VPN location (Netherlands).

### 3. Traffic Encryption Verification
- Accessed a secure HTTPS website (e.g., https://example.com).
- Confirmed presence of 🔒 padlock icon.
- Clicked the padlock to verify connection encryption (TLS 1.3).

### 4. Speed Test Comparison
Used https://fast.com to compare speeds:

| State            | IP Address Location | Download Speed | Upload Speed | Ping  |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Without VPN      | India               | 37.40 Mbps     | 35 Mbps      | 18 ms |
| With VPN         | US                  | 36.30 Mbps     | 37 Mbps      | 95 ms |

### 5. VPN Disconnect & Comparison
- Disconnected VPN and re-tested IP and speed.
- Verified return to original ISP-assigned IP address and higher speed.

### 6. Privacy Research
Conducted research on:
- VPN encryption protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard)
- Privacy features (kill switch, DNS leak protection, no-logs policy)
- Limitations of VPNs (speed, trust, tracking)
