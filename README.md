# üîê Cybersecurity Internship Task - VPN Privacy & Security

## üìå Task Name: Working with VPNs *(VPN Privacy Task)*

## üéØ Objective

Understand how VPNs enhance online privacy and security by:
- Encrypting internet traffic
- Hiding the user's IP address
- Bypassing censorship and geographic restrictions

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **VPN Providers**: ProtonVPN / Windscribe VPN (Free Tier)
- **Websites for IP and Security Testing**:
  - https://whatismyipaddress.com
  - https://fast.com or https://speedtest.net
  - https://cloudflare.com/ssl/encrypted-sni/

## ‚úÖ Steps Performed

### 1. VPN Installation
- Signed up on ProtonVPN.
- Installed VPN client (GUI on Windows / CLI on Linux).
- Connected to a VPN server (https://github.com/Yuvarajklr/task-8/blob/b46d92d0841fe7af8e4d973a198d72981b232fbc/Screenshot_2025-07-05_15_21_13.png).

### 2. IP Address Check
- Visited https://whatismyipaddress.com before and after connecting to VPN.
- My IP with VPN (https://github.com/Yuvarajklr/task-8/blob/7c50fd335eb67d69a28b7918cf23542c6a6be96a/Screenshot_2025-07-05_15_01_36.png)
- Confirmed IP address changed from original (India) to VPN location (Netherlands).

### 3. Traffic Encryption Verification
- Accessed a secure HTTPS website (e.g., https://example.com).
- Confirmed presence of üîí padlock icon.
- Clicked the padlock to verify connection encryption (TLS 1.3).
- verify connection (https://github.com/Yuvarajklr/task-8/blob/7fb745c5067115202cff7d3fbb44286cadbd1b59/Screenshot_2025-07-05_15_35_45.png)

### 4. Speed Test Comparison
Used https://fast.com to compare speeds:

| State            | IP Address Location | Download Speed | Upload Speed | Ping  |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Without VPN      | India               | 37.40 Mbps     | 35 Mbps      | 18 ms |
| With VPN         | US                  | 36.30 Mbps     | 37 Mbps      | 95 ms |

### 5. VPN Disconnect & Comparison
- Disconnected VPN and re-tested IP and speed.
- Verified return to original ISP-assigned IP address and higher speed.

### 6. Privacy Research
Conducted research on:
- VPN encryption protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard)
- Privacy features (kill switch, DNS leak protection, no-logs policy)
- Limitations of VPNs (speed, trust, tracking)
