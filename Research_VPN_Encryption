### üîê Common VPN Encryption Protocols

| Protocol       | Encryption Strength      | Description                                                             |
|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **OpenVPN**    | AES-256-bit              | Highly secure and open-source. Widely supported.                        |
| **WireGuard**  | ChaCha20 / AES-256       | Modern, fast, lightweight, and secure.                                  |
| **IKEv2/IPSec**| AES-256-bit              | Great for mobile users. Handles network changes smoothly.               |
| **L2TP/IPSec** | AES-256-bit              | Secure but slower. More easily blocked by firewalls.                    |
| **PPTP**       | 40-128-bit (Weak)        | Outdated and insecure. Not recommended for use.                         |

> ‚úÖ **Recommended:** Use VPNs with **OpenVPN** or **WireGuard** protocols for strong security.

### üõ°Ô∏è Key Privacy Features of VPNs

| Feature                 | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IP Address Masking**  | Hides your real IP and location.                                            |
| **No-Logs Policy**      | VPN provider does not store browsing activity or personal data.             |
| **Kill Switch**         | Disconnects the internet if the VPN connection drops, avoiding IP leaks.    |
| **DNS Leak Protection** | Ensures your DNS queries are private and not exposed to your ISP.           |
| **Obfuscated Servers**  | Conceals the fact you're using a VPN (useful in restrictive countries).     |
| **Split Tunneling**     | Route specific apps or traffic through the VPN, while others use normal ISP.|
| **Multi-Hop VPN**       | Routes traffic through two VPN servers for extra anonymity.                 |
